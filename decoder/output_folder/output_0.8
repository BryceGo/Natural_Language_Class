honourable senators , what happened here , last Tuesday ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended on the first of this committee meeting . 
and I expected the committee admits that it does too knew what to do with the independent senators . 
what will not so concern for the time . 
the members of the selection committee can show some impact . 
the business which on a senator reshape over the next two years . 
this is a important committee , because , in principle , these nine senators sit committee to determine what some senators . 
therefore my introduced in the sitting of the committee to yesterday to realize that one of the nine not attend senators . 
it was sent a replacement . 
honourable senators person name , I do . 
you can see how now to , i am friendly ' t it ? 
the senators will have to find their own research who was on fault . 
when an individual accepts an the work , it must do . 
the women who sit on the Senate have proven . 
they remplissaient their duty much more that the majority of the men in the Senate . 
i remember as the sessions held that the committee to the of veterans in February 1998 . 
the Senate Ni or the House of Commons do not sitting in that point . 
three senators saw Liberals to proceedings of the committee , all of women . 
the officers of the Senate could not find a man to this committee . 
i could cite , word by word , what the hon. senator Carstairs took answered the question I asked . 
i asked him : " Quels were the criteria are as follows ? " 
it has stated that she was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
that it had on the parliamentary associations drafted in 1993 . 
at the time Les delegations formées men were only from . 
on this matter , this is I was replaced by Senator Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I still look re - enter the opportunity to my association preferred . 
honourable senators , I do not know how or when the House will be decision about these two reports . 
every once the senators on television are verdict . 
wondered or by a group of students , or any of journalists . 
say that we do ? 
it is true , and I will believe . 
however , that should being translated in fact . 
i think not replacing the to . 
if a senator accept this position in a committee , he should participate or it to all the meetings intended . 
we are not the members of the words in which the corridors : 
- Présentez " you in the committee and today , after two years of education , there is a vote in committee final '' . 
they do not even know what they are viewed sang , but when they came to their leaders sang to them . 
absolutely not they do not know what has happened . 
honourable the words " senators , " and " continuité dedication '' , come in our way to the speech . 
over the next two weeks , beginning to reflect on the way we will address the senators independent of the situation . 
if we do , I are not the créerai my own committee of parliamentarians who are concerned about the world affairs . 
we are no one can gained . 
the Speaker : Honour his 
if any other hon. senator do wishes to speak , is it the pleasure , you honourable senators , to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
